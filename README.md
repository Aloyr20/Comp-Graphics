# Computer-Graphics In Class Activity 1

Attached below is an image of the shaders made into a material and being attached to the cat model. It follows this order from left to right:
1. MultiUV uv0
2. MultiUV uv1
3. MultiUV ViewDir uv0
4. MultiUV ViewDir uv1
5. Debug
6. Reflection
7. AllProps range 0/rgb 0
8. AllProps range 5
9. AllProps deafult

Activity Reflection:
This week we had our first in class activity in Intro to Computer Graphics. I feel like my strength when completing this activity was my debuging skills. Espescially because of coding off of the slides, you are bound to eventually run into syntax errors or other problems within the shaders and low and behold I ran into a few. By using debug tactics like commenting out lines of code and following the errors location from the console I was able to fix all my errors/problems easily. When thinking about my weaknesses while doing this activity, I think of my speed of coding the shader. Since we are still in the early part about learning how to code shaders, I felt that my speed was alot slower in coding the shaders then in comparrision to me coding a c# script for a enemy and player for a game. I believe through more and more practice I will be able to code shaders fasters then before.
